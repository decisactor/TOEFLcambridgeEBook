     <tpObject>43,574,454,0,Due to the Coriolis force, icebergs move at a right angle to the prevailing wind.</tpObject>
     <tpObject>534,571,444,0,Because of the Earth's rotation, objects moving away from or toward the equator travel at different speeds in relation to fixed points at different latitudes.</tpObject>
     <tpObject>44,649,454,0,In order to reach the correct destination, an airplane pilot must adjust direction to compensate for the Coriolis force.</tpObject>
     <tpObject>534,650,425,0,Because of deflection and differences in linear speed, ocean currents move at an angle to the wind.</tpObject>
     <tpObject>43,728,466,0,Water at successively lower levels is deflected at an angle to the layer immediately above it, and this creates a spiral.</tpObject>
